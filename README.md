### Problem:

IRCO offers hundreds of different programs to thousands of immigrants and refugees throughout the northwest Oregon and southwest Washington region. With such a wide variety of programming, keeping track of upcoming events can be a challenge for participants.

### Solution:

Starting with the SUN school program, we created a text notification app where families can sign up to receive reminders about upcoming after-school classes. With a very simple UI, users are able to easily add their phone number, select their school, and opt in to reminders about their chosen programs. Using the To Google Translate Firefox extension, users can translate messages into their language of choice. This app could potentially be expanded to deliver reminders to participants in the various other IRCO programs.
